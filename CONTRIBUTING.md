The GitHub Repo now has Milestones (aka to-do lists) that have tasks that need to be completed. If the task is completed there is a noted reward: "Contributor Reward - x% of the Pool". There are 750,000 VLTFI tokens allocated to contributors to the project. These are rewards for those who help. Click on this link here: https://github.com/TheLazySol/VaultiFi/milestones to view what needs to be done. 

Furthermore, Issues that need to be resolved are posted in the Issues section of the GitHub repo: https://github.com/TheLazySol/VaultiFi/issues -- Here issues are listed and are set publicly for anyone to try and solve Unless your GitHub Account has been assigned to that task. 

Anyone is able to add issues to the GitHub as long as a flair/tag is added. Which you can find on the right of your screen when creating an issue. These tags range from bugs to requests for new ideas. 

This entire environment is set in a way for people to partake in this project in an open-source format. 

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CREATE A PULL REQUEST WHEN UPLOADING FILES TO THE REPO <<< You will not have to do this if you are simply "solving" issues and Milestones.
